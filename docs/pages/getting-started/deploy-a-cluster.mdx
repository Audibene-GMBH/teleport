A Teleport cluster includes two components that manage access to resources in
your infrastructure:

- The **Teleport Auth Service** hosts the certificate authorities for users and
  resources in your cluster. It authenticates users to your cluster, executes
  role-based access controls, and issues credentials to enable secure
  communication.
- The **Teleport Proxy Service** manages communication between the Auth Service,
  users, and your infrastructure. Resources in your infrastructure can run
  within a private network while the Proxy Service routes client traffic to
  them. This means that you can secure your entire infrastructure behind a
  single domain name.

Teleport has three editions:

- Open Source Teleport
- Teleport Cloud
- Teleport Enterprise

For a detailed comparison of Teleport's editions, please see [our FAQ page](../faq.mdx#how-is-open-source-different-from-enterprise).

## Open Source Teleport

Open Source Teleport enables you to deploy and manage the Auth Service and Proxy
Service on your own infrastructure, then secure your servers, databases, Windows
desktops, Kubernetes clusters, and internal web applications.

You can get help from our
[discussion forum](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/discussions) and
[community Slack channel](https://goteleport.com/slack), or even clone our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) to investigate
the source.

## Teleport Cloud

Teleport Cloud is a managed deployment of the Auth Service and Proxy Service.
Our team takes care of upgrades, security patches, scaling, monitoring, backend
management, and other administration tasks.

A Teleport Cloud account takes minutes to set up. After that, you can define
RBAC rules, register Single Sign-On providers, and start connecting all of your
infrastructure.

## Teleport Enterprise

Teleport Enterprise is a self-hosted deployment of the Auth Service and Proxy
Service that is intended for large organizations with requirements for full
customization and the highest security standards. 

Teleport Enterprise is FedRAMP compliant and lets you use Teleport with
your own hardware security module.
